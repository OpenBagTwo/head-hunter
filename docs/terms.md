## Use of Head Hunter data packs

Any data packs you generate using this package are subject to the terms laid out
by the author of the original data  packs. Assuming you're using the packs from
Vanilla Tweaks, that means you're subject to
[their terms of use](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/head-hunter/blob/main/Head%20Hunter/LICENSE.txt)
the relevant portions of which state:

> 1.1. You cannot redistribute our tweaks as they are, without proper **modification and/or additions**.

/

> 1.4 You can distribute your pack with our tweaks, as long as your pack includes proper modification and/or additions.

This is covered by your very use of this tool.

> 1.3. You cannot distribute our tweaks without appropriate credit (refer to Section 2).

/

> 1.5. You can distribute your pack with our tweaks, as long as you have appropriately credited Vanilla Tweaks (refer to Section 2).

/

> 2.2. You must create a `credits.txt` within your project that includes the below text.
>
> ```
> Credits:
> Vanilla Tweaks: https://vanillatweaks.net/
> ```

Just such a [`credits.txt`](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/head-hunter/blob/main/Head%20Hunter/credits.txt)
file is provided for you in the Head Hunter folder and will be included automatically
with your pack when using this package.

> 1.2. You cannot restrict access or sell any pack that includes our tweaks through donations and/or a paywall.

/

> 1.6. You can distribute your pack with our tweaks, as long as it is free to use for the community.

/

> 2.1. You must include the below text on all main publishing platforms that you may use. (Minecraft Forum, Planet Minecraft, Minecraft Maps, Curseforge, etc.).

So:

- no Patreon exclusives
- no selling of the packs
- but publishing the sites on ad-supported platforms is fine so long as you
  paste the contents of `credits.txt` in the listing description
